- 👋 Hi, I’m @wagardm
- 👀 I’m passionate about data analysis! I have a background in programming and business systems analysis but I have been out of the field for a while. I recently completed
  the the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, in which I began learning R. I am finishing my first project using R Markdown and this is where I will store it and 
  future projects. 
- 💞️ I might be interested in collaborating with someone on an interesting project at some point...
- 📫 You can reach me at dette_wagar@outlook.com ...
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her...
- ⚡ Fun fact(s): I love to learn! I have 4 college degrees: a bachelor's in violin performance, a master's in music theory, a bachelor's in computer science,
- and a master's in special education. (I even completed the coursework for a phD in music theory but left before the general exams and dissertation.) When I am not
- analyzing one thing or another, I prefer to be singing (most likely an aria from Handel's Messiah) or biking or spending time with my husband and teenage sons.
